          Fixed deposit.
        </p>

        <p>
           <h5> A <b>fixed deposit (FD)</b> is a tenured deposit account provided by banks or non-bank financial institutions which provides investors a higher rate of interest than a regular savings account, until the given maturity date. It may or may not require the creation of a separate account. The term fixed deposit is most commonly used in India and the United States.
             It is known as a term deposit or time deposit in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and as a bond in the United Kingdom.</h5>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h5> In India these investments can be safer than Post Office Schemes as they are covered by the Indian Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). However, DICGC guarantees amount up to ₹ 500000 (about $6850) per depositor per bank.[3] In India they also offer income tax and wealth tax benefits.</h5>
         </p>

        <p>
            <h5> Nowadays, banks give the facility of Flexi or sweep in FD, where in customers can withdraw their money through ATM, through cheque or through funds transfer from their FD account. In such cases, whatever interest is accrued on the amount they have withdrawn will be credited to their savings account (the account that has been linked to their FD) and the balance amount will automatically be converted in their new FD. This system helps them in getting their funds from their FD account at the times of emergency in a timely manner.</h5>
         </p>


         <p>
            <h5>In India, tax is deducted at source by the banks on FDs if interest paid to a customer at any bank exceeds ₹ 10,000 in a financial year.
                 This is applicable to both interest payable or reinvested per customer. This is called Tax deducted at Source and is presently fixed at 10% of the interest.
                  With CBS banks can tally FD holding of a customer across various branches and TDS is applied if interest exceeds ₹ 10,000. 
                  Banks issue Form 16 A every quarter to the customer, as a receipt for Tax Deducted at Source.</h5>
         </p>

 

         <p>
            <h5>However, tax on interest from fixed deposits is not 10%; it is applicable at the rate of tax slab of the deposit holder. If any tax on Fixed Deposit interest is due after TDS, the holder is expected to declare it in Income Tax returns and pay it by himself.

                If the total income for a year does not fall within the overall taxable limits, customers can submit a Form 15 G (below 60 years of age) or Form 15 H (above 60 years of age) to the bank when starting the FD and at the start of every financial year to avoid TDS.</h5>
